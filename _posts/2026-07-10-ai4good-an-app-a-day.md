excerpt: "Six apps in eighteen days — a kids' education app, an Indian-language health app, two heritage games, a video editor, and a GPS camera — each built from a laptop with AI in the loop and shipped free to all. This is the #AI4Good build story, chapter by chapter, with live links and screenshots."

![AI4Good — six apps, eighteen days, AI for good]({{ img | append: '/hero.png' | relative_url }})

> **#AI4Good** started as a dare to myself: *can I use AI to build and ship something genuinely useful — for kids, for health, for our culture — one build at a time?* Eighteen days later there were **six live apps**, each free, each on GitHub Pages with an Android build. This is the story of how they came to be, in the order they were born.

I'm **[Naveen Gopalakrishna](/AI4Good/about/)** — an AI Global Black Belt at Microsoft by day, a compulsive builder by night. The tooling that made this pace possible was **GitHub Copilot CLI in autopilot mode** (the agent researches, writes code, runs builds, and renders assets autonomously) sitting on top of **Azure AI** — `gpt-image-2` for art, Azure Speech for narration, and open models from Hugging Face for the heavy lifting. But tools are just tools. The thread that ties these six together is a question I kept asking: **who does this help?**

Let's walk the timeline.

## Jun 23 — ActionCut: put a pro video studio in everyone's pocket

![ActionCut landing page]({{ img | append: '/shot-actioncut.png' | relative_url }})

The first build set the tone: take something normally locked behind subscriptions and make it **free and open**. [**ActionCut**](https://naveenneog.github.io/ActionCut/) is a CapCut-class Android video editor — a real **multi-track timeline**, **LUT color filters**, GPU effects, audio mixing, and one-tap **export presets** for every platform. Built in **Kotlin + Jetpack Compose + Media3**.

**The good:** creators on entry-level Android phones get studio-grade editing without a paywall or a watermark. Storytelling shouldn't require a subscription.

## Jun 26 — KidKat: only the good stuff, for curious kids

![KidKat landing page]({{ img | append: '/shot-kidkat.png' | relative_url }})

This is the app that named the whole campaign. [**KidKat**](https://naveenneog.github.io/KidKat/) plays a **finite, parent-approved stream** of short educational videos — inside the official YouTube player, using the official Data API, fully **ToS-compliant**. No infinite feed. No algorithmic rabbit holes. No doomscroll. A parent allowlist decides what's on the menu. Built with **Flutter** for Android and iOS.

**The good:** it turns the most anxiety-inducing part of modern parenting — handing a child a screen — into something calm and intentional. **AI for good starts with protecting the youngest users.**

## Jun 27 — NeoFit: health that speaks your language

![NeoFit landing page — Sehat, simple banayi]({{ img | append: '/shot-neofit.png' | relative_url }})

*"Sehat, simple banayi."* [**NeoFit**](https://naveenneog.github.io/NeoFit/) is a science-informed **Indian** health and fitness app in **22 Indian languages** — calorie tracking that actually knows *dosa, biryani, and gulab jamun*, **on-device food recognition**, AI-generated food photos, AI exercise videos, and Health Connect sync. Offline-first, **powered by Azure AI**, Kotlin/Compose.

**The good:** most fitness apps assume you eat like the West and read English fluently. NeoFit meets 1.4 billion people where they are — in their language, with their food. **Inclusion is a health outcome.**

## Jul 04 — GpsCamera: proof you can trust

![GpsCamera landing page — geotag every photo, exactly]({{ img | append: '/shot-gpscamera.png' | relative_url }})

[**GpsCamera**](https://naveenneog.github.io/GpsCamera/) is a fast, native Android camera that **burns your exact location and a live mini-map onto every photo**, writes standards-compliant **GPS EXIF**, and files each shot into its own album. Kotlin, Compose, CameraX.

**The good:** field engineers, insurance surveyors, community reporters, and site inspectors need **verifiable, tamper-evident documentation**. A trustworthy timestamped-and-geotagged photo is a small tool that quietly protects people.

## Jul 06 — Sopāna: a Snakes & Ladders that teaches

![Sopana landing page — Moksha Patam]({{ img | append: '/shot-sopana.png' | relative_url }})

[**Sopāna**](https://naveenneog.github.io/Sopana/) reclaims the game the West calls *Snakes & Ladders* and restores its origin — the ancient Indian **Moksha Patam**, where **every snake is a vice and every ladder a virtue**. Land on one and the game **animates and reads its meaning aloud**. Play three ways (a 2D board, a 2.5D cinematic mode, and a 3D camera), across four worlds, with up to four players on one screen. A web PWA plus an Android APK.

**The good:** it turns a children's game back into what it was designed to be — a gentle lesson in ethics and consequence, wrapped in cultural heritage. **AI narration and art make an 800-year-old teaching tool feel alive again.**

## Jul 09 — Chaturanga: ancient chess, reborn in glowing 3D

![Chaturanga landing page — the four-army game of dharma]({{ img | append: '/shot-chaturanga.png' | relative_url }})

[**Chaturanga**](https://naveenneog.github.io/Chaturanga/) is the ancient Indian "game of the four divisions," played with modern chess rules but **authentic piece identities** — Raja, Mantri, Gaja, Ashva, Ratha, Padati — carved in **real-time glowing 3D**. It ships with a **teaching AI** (five levels), a **coach** that reviews your blunders, an **openings trainer**, a rotating piece inspector, and a *Warrior's Eye* camera. Four worlds, each teaching a moral lesson.

The pieces themselves are an AI-for-good story: I generated each one from a single concept image using a **free Hugging Face Space** and headless Blender — [the full image-to-3D pipeline is its own post here]({{ '/2026/07/10/image-to-3d-huggingface-blender-copilot/' | relative_url }}).

**The good:** a free, offline, no-sign-in chess tutor that also carries culture — learning and heritage in one board.

## What #AI4Good actually means

Look at the six together and a pattern appears — not "AI apps," but **apps that use AI to do something good**:

| Day | App | Who it serves | The good |
|-----|-----|---------------|----------|
| Jun 23 | [ActionCut](https://naveenneog.github.io/ActionCut/) | Creators | Studio-grade editing, free |
| Jun 26 | [KidKat](https://naveenneog.github.io/KidKat/) | Kids & parents | Safe, finite, educational screen time |
| Jun 27 | [NeoFit](https://naveenneog.github.io/NeoFit/) | 1.4B Indians | Health in 22 languages |
| Jul 04 | [GpsCamera](https://naveenneog.github.io/GpsCamera/) | Field workers | Verifiable documentation |
| Jul 06 | [Sopāna](https://naveenneog.github.io/Sopana/) | Families | Values + heritage, playfully |
| Jul 09 | [Chaturanga](https://naveenneog.github.io/Chaturanga/) | Learners | Free chess tutor + culture |

**The method:** one build at a time, from a single laptop, with **Copilot CLI autopilot** doing the heavy lifting and **Azure AI** + **Hugging Face** models supplying the intelligence. **The mission:** put that capability toward education, health, culture, and trust — and give it away.

This is just the beginning of the campaign. Next up the runway: **Indian Tales**, a multilingual Togalu Gombe (shadow-puppet) storytelling app to keep a fading folk art alive.

If you build things, I'd gently challenge you to the same dare: **pick the "who does this help?" first, then let AI help you ship it.** That's **#AI4Good**.

*Follow the journey — [GitHub](https://github.com/naveenneog) · [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naveen-gopalakrishna-99863040/). Built one day at a time.*
